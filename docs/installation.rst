Installation
============

.. note::
    We **strongly recommend** using ``CuBIDS`` with environment management.
    For this, we recommend `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
    (`miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_ for M1 Chip Mac Machines).

Once you've installed conda,
initialize a new conda environment (for example, named ``cubids``) as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n cubids python=3.12 pip
    $ conda activate cubids

You are now ready to install CuBIDS.
You can do so in one of two ways.

To obtain ``CuBIDS`` locally, we can use ``pip`` to download our software from the
`Python Package Manager (Pypi) <https://pypi.org/project/cubids/>`_ by running the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install CuBIDS

Alternatively,
you can clone the source code for ``CuBIDS`` from our `GitHub repository`_ using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/PennLINC/CuBIDS.git

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd CuBIDS
    $ pip install -e .

We will now need to install some dependencies of ``CuBIDS``.
To do this, we first must install deno to run `bids-validator`.
We can accomplish this using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install deno

The new schema-based ``bids-validator`` doesn't need to be installed 
and will be implemented automatically when `cubids validate` is called

.. dropdown:: If there is no Internet connection on compute nodes

    If your HPC doesn't allow internet access on its compute nodes, it won't be able to run the online 
    version of the BIDS validator. In that scenario, you need to install the BIDS validator on your HPC 
    and then point to the installed version in your cubids validate calls. 
    To do that, you should run one of these commands below, after installing deno, that downloads the latest version 
    of the bids-validator in your virtual environment either by installing a lightscript version 
    (into ``$HOME/.deno/bin``) or by compiling, respectively:

    ..  code-block:: console

        $ deno install -ERN -g -n bids-validator jsr:@bids/validator
    
    or:

    ..  code-block:: console

        $ deno compile -ERN -o bids-validator jsr:@bids/validator

    For more information, you can read: https://bids-validator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/command-line.html

We also recommend using ``CuBIDS`` with the optional ``DataLad`` version control capabilities.
We use ``DataLad`` throughout our walkthrough of the CuBIDS Workflow on
:doc:`the Example Walkthrough page <example>`.
To leverage the version control capabilities,
you will need to install both ``DataLad`` and ``git-annex``,
the large file storage software ``DataLad`` runs under the hood.
Installation instructions for ``DataLad`` and ``git-annex`` can be found
`here <https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html>`_.
