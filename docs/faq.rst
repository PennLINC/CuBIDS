Does CuBIDS work on all BIDS datasets?
--------------------------------------

CuBIDS relies on many hardcoded rules and data types,
so it may not work on all BIDS datasets.
Some datatypes, such as EEG data, are not yet supported,
as well as some configurations of supported datatypes, such as multi-echo fMRI.
If you encounter an issue, please open an issue on the CuBIDS GitHub repository.
