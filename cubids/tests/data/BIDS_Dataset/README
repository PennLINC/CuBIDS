Heavily downsampled CS-DSI testing datasets

This data has had some parameters changed so that there are different
parameter groups in the same key groups.

## Changes

 - sub-01_ses-phdiff_acq-HASC55AP_dwi: EchoTime set to 0.04 from 0.089
 - sub-02_ses-phdiff_task-rest_bold: Fieldmap has been removed
 - sub-03_ses-phdiff_task-rest_bold: FlipAngle set to 70 from 90
